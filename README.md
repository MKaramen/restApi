<h1> Rest Api </h1>

<p>I followed Academind's tutorial called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51q4D-B63KBnygU6opNPFk_q">Building a REST API with Node.js</a>" in order to learn Node.js and APIs</p>

<h2>Function of the API</h2>

<p>The API can create,delete,select, update Products and Orders.
It also features a authentication system</p>

<h2>What's next ?</h2>
<p>Create an interface to use the api</p>
